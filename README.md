# A* Implementation 

This is the implementation of A* algorithm for rigid robots. This is our implementation of Project 3 phase 3 as part of the course ENPM661.

## Dependencies
This code was tested with the following dependencies:
- Python 3
- Opencv 3.4.5
- Numpy

## Directories list

Project3
├── astar.py
└── README.md



## Instructions

The directory `Project3` has two files astar.py and README. The file `astar.py` contains the `main()` method.

### Instructions to run the python script
- Open new terminal window in the current directory and run the command
```
python3 astar.py
```  
- Enter the start node, goal node (in format [x,y,theta]), rpm of the actions in the cartesian coordinates.
- If the arguments are passed properly, the robot will start exploration and a new window is popped which shows the representation.
- The shortest path is stored in the `shortest_path` attribute of the Map class.
